# Advent of Code

My solutions for the problems presented in the [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/). Each day is stored in the folder with its name.

## 2021 

I found the problems harder this year. I've also solved one by hand ([day 23](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/21)). The code I've tried is still in its folder, but it didn't work...
A lot of the problems after [day 19](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/19) were bruteforcing the way out of it, except if you had a genius insight (or if you are smart maybe ? Don't know, didn't test that). But I've had a lot of fun cracking these, notably day 19 with a pretty good heuristic, and [day 24](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/24) doing some reverse engineering of my input while my brute force was running (it took some hours, so I had a lot of time on my hands). Got the 50 stars this year. I've had enough of python tho, next year I may do it in another language...

## 2020 - Result

48 stars out of 50. I didn't know how to do the part 2 of [day 20](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/20). I passed the first part of the problem by "cheating" (calculation of the number of edges between the tiles in order to recover those that have the least number of edges in common with the others), but couldn't reconstruct the whole image. Anyway, I think it's good enough for a first participation. Here's what I got at the end :
