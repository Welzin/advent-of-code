# Advent of Code

My solutions for the problems presented in the [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/). Each day is stored in the folder with its name. Each folder contains 3 files :

- input, the input file for the problem
- part1.py, the algo to solve the part1 of the problem
- part2.py, the algo to solve the part2 of the problem

I first heard about *Advent of Code* last year, when it was almost finished. I had a lot of work and didn't really have the motivation to do it afterwards. This year, I've participated in 3 contests of code, and the result... wasn't satisfactory. Even though I've finished 70th on [the shaker's contest](https://le-shaker.com/en/) and top 1000 in the 2 [BattleDevs](https://battledev.blogdumoderateur.com/), I still couldn't go through the 4th exercise. So, after the last BattleDev, I've thought about it, and decided to do one exercise every day. I started the 27th November, on [CodinGame](https://www.codingame.com/), with 2 goals :

- Learn python3
- Learn widely known algorithms 

And then came the 1st of December. Someone reminded me about *Advent of Code*. And here I am, with updated objectives :

- Learn python3
- Learn widely known algorithms
- Get at least 35 stars

### Result 

Currently : 26 stars out of 26.
