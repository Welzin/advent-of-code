# Advent of Code

My solutions for the problems presented in the [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/). Each day is stored in the folder with its name. Each folder contains 3 files :

- input, the input file for the problem
- part1.py, the algo to solve the part1 of the problem
- part2.py, the algo to solve the part2 of the problem

Anyway, I think it's good enough for a first participation. Here's what I got at the end :
